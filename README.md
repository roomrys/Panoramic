# Panoramic
Feature-Invariant image stitching

## Note

Work-in-progress. Project on hold due to other interests. Currently implementing SIFT algorithm to extract features

## Vision

Create own panoramic image stitching algorithm. 

* Use Scale-Invariant Feature Transfom (SIFT) to extract features regardless of image scale/rotation.
* Map correlated features accross images.
* Perform image stitching using homography.
